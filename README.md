## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the admission chances of students applying to UCLA. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset includes several features such as GRE scores, GPA, and other academic indicators that are typically used in the admission process. The dataset is expected to be clean and ready for analysis.

## Installation

To run the notebook and experiment with the model, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UCLA-Admission-Prediction.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Predicting-of-admission-into-UCLA
   ```
   
3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predicting-of-admission-into-UCLA/Predicting Admission into UCLA.ipynb
   ```

5. **Run the notebook cells** to train and evaluate the model.

## Model

The notebook explores various machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks

The final model selection is based on accuracy and other performance metrics.And it is Linear Regression here.

## Results

The results section provides an analysis of the model's performance. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and any visualizations that help in understanding the model's predictions.
